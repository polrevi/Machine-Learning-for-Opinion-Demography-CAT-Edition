# Opinion and Demography in Catalonia ‚Äì Machine Learning Analysis

This project explores the relationship between public opinion and sociodemographic characteristics in Catalonia using machine learning techniques. It is divided into two main parts:

## üîç Project Overview

1. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   We apply dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to group individuals based on their opinions on public affairs.

2. **Supervised Learning**  
   We build predictive models to estimate an individual's opinion group using sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, and place of birth.

The analysis aims to uncover patterns in public opinion and understand how they are linked to demographic factors.
